# Contributing

PRs are welcome.

## Guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Preserve local-first behavior.
- Do not add cloud dependencies to core paths.
- Include clear reproduction steps for bug fixes.

## Commit style

Use conventional commits when possible:
- `feat:`
- `fix:`
- `docs:`
- `chore:`
